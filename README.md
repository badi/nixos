# About

This repository contains my NixOS configuration files.

There are several machines, each defined within a subdirectory:

- `fangorn`: main development node
- `fea`: router
- `glaurung`: media center
- `este`: laptop
- `namo`: fileserver

These are deployed by NixOps (see [network.nix](./network.nix)).
